Just off the north coast of continental Europe, there is an island called Great Britain. Today, this island is closely connected to the rest of Europe; there are direct trains to Paris and Brussels, and thousands of people, cars and lorries cross the Channel and the North Sea every day between British and continental ports.
Britain is very much a part of Europe; we are Europeans, and British history and culture are part of European history and culture. In 1973, after years of discussion, Britain joined the European Union. However many of the people in Britain have never liked being in the E.U.; they imagine that Britain is very different from other countries. Some believe that Britain is better than other countries.
In 2016, the people of Britain (or more exactly, just over half of Britain's voters) voted for "Brexit".  So in March 2019, Britain will probably leave the European Union.  Why ?
"We're different, aren't we?" says Eddie, from London. "We do things differently. We don't want to become like other countries."
Millions of people think the same as Eddie. For example, a large majority did not want Britain to join the Euro. They imagine that Britain's "identity" will be lost, if we say goodbye to our pounds and our pennies. They forget that things are also very different from one European country to another. 
It's quite a strange situation really; but it is a situation that can easily be explained.
