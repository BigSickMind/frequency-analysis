         -------------------------------------------------------

This list records the titles in the movie database for which we believe we
have complete crew credits. This means that all the non-cast names listed
on screen in the credits of the movies have been entered into the movie
database. This includes everyone from director to third assistant caterer --
if they have an onscreen credit then they are listed in the database. For
older movies fewer people were actually credited but nonetheless we want to
track those cases too.

The pupose of the list is to help us track which movies are fully covered and
allow us to identify areas where we need more help. The list also provides
some individual recognition for people who've put a lot of work into supplying
the movie database and hopefully will encourage more people to submit additions
on a title by title basis.

If you have copies of your favourite movies on tape/LD at home, why not help
to complete the information on them directly from credits of your copy? The
new "UPDATE TITLE" interface provides the most straightforward way to add
data to the movie database on a title by title basis. There are no special
formats to use - you simply edit the information in a form you are used to
seeing and send it back to the movie mail-server for processing. For a simple
guide send e-mail with the subject "HELP UPDATE" to <mail-server@imdb.com>

Some notes on the list:

 * Each entry lists a title along with it's completion status. The status can
   either be "Complete" which means someone has completed the cast entries
   for that title, or it can be "Complete+Verified" to indicate that someone
   has also verified the completion from their copy.

 * The league table above includes counts for completions and verifications.

 * In some cases we have more information in the movie database than appears
   in the credits. The point is to record when all the crew information in
   the credits has been recorded to save duplicated efforts later.

 * There are probably hundreds of movies in the database which were completed
   prior to when I began keeping records.

 * See the companion 'complete-cast.list' file for the cast completion
   information.
